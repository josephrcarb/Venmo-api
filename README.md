# Venmo-Api Wrapper Implementation

**Venmo-Api** This application was developed to implement the pypi Venmo-Api Wrapper by Mark Mohades

## Include
pip install venmo-api <br>
pip install flask

## Description / Use
* **Disclaimer:** 
	- Any login credentials inputted, are not saved. Entire application runs strictly on localhost and only information is exchanged with the venmo api, no other database.
	
* **Current Use:** 
	- cd into folder with app.py
	- server run on localhost:5000/
	- "python app.py"
	- Enter in login credentials into textbox

* **Reason for application:** 
	- Displays the total amount of money sent and recieved from all the users within the last 50 transactions.
	- History of transactions between users for personal use, maintaining finances. Small project to for me to understand Api integration.
